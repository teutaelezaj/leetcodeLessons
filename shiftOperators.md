# Shift Operators

**Left Shift:**
```
int a = 8; //1 0 0 0
int b = a << 2; // 1 0 0 0 0 0 -> adds 2 zeros, value is now 32
 
System.out.println(b);
Output = 32
```

**Right Shift:**
```
int a = 8; //1 0 0 0
int b = a >> 2; // 1 0 -> removes 2 zeros, value is now 2
 
System.out.println(b);
Output = 2
```
**Changing the Value of int a:**
```
int a = 25; //1 1 0 0 1
int b = a >> 2; // 1 1 0 -> removes the last 2 values, value is now 6
System.out.println(b)
Output = 6
```
## Leetcode "Number of 1 Bits"
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

**Solution**
```
public class Solution {
   public int hammingWeight(int n) { 
    int bits = 0; 
    int mask = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) { //32 bits long
        if ((n & mask) != 0) { 
            bits++; //increment up
        }
        mask <<= 1; //shift to the left by one
    }
    return bits;
    }
}
```
You could also do 
`return Integer.bitCount(n);`
Which returns the count of the number of one-bits in the twoâ€™s complement binary representation of an int value.
